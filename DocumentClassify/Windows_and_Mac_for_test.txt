at the windows hardware engineering conference winhec in may  microsoft gave their first public demonstrations of the new desktop window manager and aero the demonstrations were done on a revised build  which was never released a number of sessions for developers and hardware engineers at the conference focused on these new features as well as the nextgeneration secure computing base previously known as palladium which at the time was microsofts proposed solution for creating a secure computing environment whereby any given component of the system could be deemed trusted also at this conference microsoft reiterated their roadmap for delivering longhorn pointing to an early  release datedevelopment resetby  it had become obvious to the windows team at microsoft that they were losing sight of what needed to be done to complete the next version of windows and ship it to customers internally some microsoft employees were describing the longhorn project as another cairo or caironet referring to the cairo development project that the company embarked on through the first half of the s which never resulted in a shipping operating system though nearly all the technologies developed in that time did end up in windows  and windows nt microsoft was shocked in  by apples release of mac os x tiger it offered only a limited subset of features planned for longhorn in particular fast file searching and integrated graphics and sound processing but appeared to have impressive reliability and performance compared to contemporary longhorn builds most longhorn builds had major explorerexe system leaks which prevented the os from performing well and added more confusion to the development teams in later builds with more and more code being developed which failed to reach stabilityin a  september  frontpage article on the wall street journal microsoft copresident jim allchin who had overall responsibility for the development and delivery of windows explained how development of longhorn had been crashing into the ground due in large part to the haphazard methods by which features were introduced and integrated into the core of the operating system without a clear focus on an endproduct allchin went on to explain how in december  he enlisted the help of two other senior executives brian valentine and amitabh srivastava the former being experienced with shipping software at microsoft most notably windows server  and the latter having spent his career at microsoft researching and developing methods of producing highquality testing systems srivastava employed a team of core architects to visually map out the entirety of the windows operating system and to proactively work towards a development process that would enforce high levels of code quality reduce interdependencies between components and in general not make things worse with vista since microsoft decided that longhorn needed to be further componentized work started on the omega series builds where they would componentize existing windows server  source code and over time add back functionality as development progressed future longhorn builds would start from windows server  service pack  and continue from therethis change announced internally to microsoft employees on  august  began in earnest in september though it would take several more months before the new development process and build methodology would be used by all of the development teams a number of complaints came from individual developers and bill gates himself that the new development process was going to be prohibitively difficult to work withinas windows vistaby approximately november  the company had considered several names for the final release ranging from simple to fanciful and inventive in the end microsoft chose windows vista as confirmed on  july  believing it to be a wonderful intersection of what the product really does what windows stands for and what resonates with customers and their needs
 group project manager greg sullivan told paul thurrott you want the pc to adapt to you and help you cut through the clutter to focus on whats important to you thats what windows vista is all about bringing clarity to your world a reference to the three marketing points of vistaclear connected confident so you can focus on what matters to you microsoft copresident jim allchin also loved the name saying that vista creates the right imagery for the new product capabilities and inspires the imagination with all the possibilities of what can be done with windowsmaking peoples passions come aliveafter longhorn was named windows vista in november  an unprecedented betatest program was started involving hundreds of thousands of volunteers and companies in september of that year microsoft started releasing regular community technology previews ctp to beta testers from july  to february  the first of these was distributed at the  microsoft professional developers conference and was subsequently released to beta testers and microsoft developer network subscribers the builds that followed incorporated most of the planned features for the final product as well as a number of changes to the user interface based largely on feedback from beta testers windows vista was deemed featurecomplete with the release of the february ctp released on  february  and much of the remainder of the work between that build and the final release of the product focused on stability performance application and driver compatibility and documentation beta  released in late may was the first build to be made available to the general public through microsofts customer preview program it was downloaded by over five million people two release candidates followed in september and october both of which were made available to a large number of usersat the intel developer forum on  march  microsoft announced a change in their plans to support efi in windows vista the uefi  specification which replaces efi  was not completed until early  and at the time of microsofts announcement no firmware manufacturers had completed a production implementation which could be used for testing as a result the decision was made to postpone the introduction of uefi support to windows support for uefi on bit platforms was postponed until vista service pack  and windows server  and bit uefi would not be supported as microsoft does not expect many such systems to be built as the market moves to bit processorswhile microsoft had originally hoped to have the consumer versions of the operating system available worldwide in time for christmas  it announced in march  that the release date would be pushed back to january  in order to give the companyand the hardware and software companies that microsoft depends on for providing device driversadditional time to prepare because a release to manufacturing rtm build is the final version of code shipped to retailers and other distributors the purpose of a prertm build is to eliminate any last showstopper bugs that may prevent the code from responsibly being shipped to customers as well as anything else that consumers may find annoying
 thus it is unlikely that any major new features would be introduced instead work would focus on vistas fitandfinish in just a few days developers had managed to drop vistas bug count from over  on  september to just over  by the time rc shipped in early october however they still had a way to go before vista was ready to rtm microsofts internal processes required vistas bug count to drop to  or fewer before the product could go into escrow for rtm for most of the prertm builds those bit editions are only releasedon  june  windows developer philip su posted a blog entry which decried the development process of windows vista stating that the code is way too complicated and that the pace of coding has been tremendously slowed down by overbearing process the same post also described windows vista as having approximately  million lines of code with about  developers working on the product during a demonstration of the speech recognition feature new to windows vista at microsofts financial analyst meeting on  july  the software recognized the phrase dear mom as dear aunt after several failed attempts to correct the error the sentence eventually became dear aunt lets set so double the killer delete select all a developer with vistas speech recognition team later explained that there was a bug with the build of vista that was causing the microphone gain level to be set very high resulting in the audio being received by the speech recognition software being incredibly distortedwindows vista build   october  was supposed to be the rtm release but a bug which destroyed any system that was upgraded from windows xp prevented this damaging development and lowering the chance that it would hit its january  deadlinedevelopment of windows vista came to an end when microsoft announced that it had been finalized on  november  and was concluded by copresident of windows development jim allchin the rtms build number had also jumped to  to reflect vistas internal version number nt  jumping rtm build numbers is common practice among consumeroriented windows versions like windows  build  windows  se build  windows me build  or windows xp build  as compared to the businessoriented versions like windows  build  or server  build  on  november  microsoft made the final build available to msdn and technet plus subscribers a businessoriented enterprise edition was made available to volume license customers on  november windows vista was launched for general customer availability on  january new or changed featuresmain article features new to windows vistawindows vista introduced several features and functionality not present in its predecessorsenduserwindows aero the new graphical user interface is named windows aero which jim allchin stated is an acronym for authentic energetic reflective and open

 the heap manager implements additional features such as integrity checking in order to improve robustness and defend against buffer overflow security exploits although this comes at the price of breaking backward compatibility with some legacy applications a kernel transaction manager has been implemented that enables applications to work with the file system and registry using atomic transaction operationssecurityrelatedmain article security and safety features new to windows vistaimproved security was a primary design goal for vista microsofts trustworthy computing initiative which aims to improve public trust in its products has had a direct effect on its development this effort has resulted in a number of new security and safety features and an evaluation assurance level rating of user account control or uac is perhaps the most significant and visible of these changes uac is a security technology that makes it possible for users to use their computer with fewer privileges by default with a view to stopping malware from making unauthorized changes to the system this was often difficult in previous versions of windows as the previous limited user accounts proved too restrictive and incompatible with a large proportion of application software and even prevented some basic operations such as looking at the calendar from the notification tray in windows vista when an action is performed that requires administrative rights such as installinguninstalling software or making systemwide configuration changes the user is first prompted for an administrator name and password in cases where the user is already an administrator the user is still prompted to confirm the pending privileged action regular use of the computer such as running programs printing or surfing the internet does not trigger uac prompts user account control asks for credentials in a secure desktop mode in which the entire screen is dimmed and only the authorization window is active and highlighted the intent is to stop a malicious program misleading the user by interfering with the authorization window and to hint to the user the importance of the prompttesting by symantec corporation has proven the effectiveness of uac symantec used over  active malware samples consisting of backdoors keyloggers rootkits mass mailers trojan horses spyware adware and various other samples each was executed on a default windows vista installation within a standard user account uac effectively blocked over  percent of each threat excluding rootkits  percent or less of the malware that evaded uac survived a rebootinternet explorer s new security and safety features include a phishing filter idn with antispoofing capabilities and integration with systemwide parental controls for added security activex controls are disabled by default also internet explorer operates in a protected mode which operates with lower permissions than the user and runs in isolation from other applications in the operating system preventing it from accessing or modifying anything besides the temporary internet files directory
 microsofts antispyware product windows defender has been incorporated into windows providing protection against malware and other threats changes to various system configuration settings such as new autostarting applications are blocked unless the user gives consentwhereas prior releases of windows supported perfile encryption using encrypting file system the enterprise and ultimate editions of vista include bitlocker drive encryption which can protect entire volumes notably the operating system volume however bitlocker requires approximately a gigabyte partition to be permanently not encrypted and to contain system files in order for windows to boot in normal circumstances the only time this partition is accessed is when the computer is booting or when there is a windows update that changes files in this area which is a legitimate reason to access this section of the drive the area can be a potential security issue because a hexadecimal editor such as dskprobeexe or malicious software running with administrator andor kernel level privileges would be able to write to this ghost partition and allow a piece of malicious software to compromise the system or disable the encryption bitlocker can work in conjunction with a trusted platform module tpm cryptoprocessor version  embedded in a computers motherboard or with a usb key however as with other full disk encryption technologies bitlocker is vulnerable to a cold boot attack especially where tpm is used as a key protector without a boot pin being required tooa variety of other privilegerestriction techniques are also built into vista an example is the concept of integrity levels in user processes whereby a process with a lower integrity level cannot interact with processes of a higher integrity level and cannot perform dllinjection to a processes of a higher integrity level the security restrictions of windows services are more finegrained so that services especially those listening on the network have no ability to interact with parts of the operating system they do not need to obfuscation techniques such as address space layout randomization are used to increase the amount of effort required of malware before successful infiltration of a system code integrity verifies that system binaries have not been tampered with by malicious codeas part of the redesign of the network stack windows firewall has been upgraded with new support for filtering both incoming and outgoing traffic advanced packet filter rules can be created that can grant or deny communications to specific servicesthe bit versions of vista require that all device drivers be digitally signed so that the creator of the driver can be identifiedsystem managementmain article management features new to windows vistawhile much of the focus of vistas new capabilities highlighted the new userinterface security technologies and improvements to the core operating system microsoft also adding new deployment and maintenance featuresthe windows imaging format wim provides the cornerstone of microsofts new deployment and packaging system

  users can create and control up to  spaces and applications can be switched between each one creating a very large workspace the autoswitching feature in spaces has annoyed some of its users apple added a new preference in  which disabled this feature but there were still bugs found while switching windows in  this problem was addressed and was no longer an issuespotlight incorporates additional search capabilities such as boolean operators as well as the ability to search other computers with permissionstime machine an automated backup utility which allows the user to restore files that have been deleted or replaced by another version of a file though generally lauded in the press as a step forward for data recovery time machine has been criticized in multiple publications for lacking the capabilities of thirdparty backup software analyzing the feature for tidbits joe kissell pointed out that time machine does not create bootable copies of backedup volumes does not back up to airport disk hard drives and will not back up filevault encrypted home directories until the user logs out concluding that the feature is pretty good at what it does but he will only use it as part of a broader backup strategy one of these issues has been resolved however on march   updates were released for airport and time machine allowing for time machine to use a usb hard disk which has been connected to an airport extreme base stationuniversal access enhancements significant improvements to applications including voiceover along with increased support for braille closed captioning and a new highquality speech synthesis voicemany changes to the user interface such as a transparent menu bar new icons and a d dock as well as this the apple icon is now black instead of blue rl prior on the thinkmac blog criticized a number of changes to leopards user interface including the transparent menu bar and the new folder icons decreased transparency of the menu bar along with the ability to disable the menu bar transparency were added with the
